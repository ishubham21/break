# Break 

Developed using React, Node, and mongoDB, Break is an online-code-executor (sandbox environment) where users can not only run their code online, but also save it for later. 

Break currently supports all the major programming languages including C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

## Future extension - 
 
- Deleting the codes - The user will be able to delete his/her saved codes. 
- Deleting the account - The user will be able to dlete his/her user-account if he/she doesn't want to continue with Break.
- Adding support for more languages - We have covered almost all the major languages, but I want to extend it to support more languages like Rust, and Swift. 
- Using WebRTC and socket, I want to extend Break as an interviewing platform where users would be able to create interview rooms, connect over a video-based call, and share the live code with everyone present in the room.
